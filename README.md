## General info
It's easy to manage the website because the content is fully customizable from admin dashboard (ACF PRO). 
I use Custom Post to easily manage different law specialization and our team(people) section.
Repeater fields on ACF are diplayed properly on frontend no matter how much they are. Client can remove some field or add new and there is no limit. 
Webstie has 2 lagnauge version (EN/PL).
